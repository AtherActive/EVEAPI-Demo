# EVEPy
EVEPy is a Python library (Work In Progress) that hooks into the eve API. It also has hooks in EVEMarketer's API for market data. It was made to make it easier to read data form teh api in Python, without having to rewrite everything every single time! This library mostly returns structured data, so make sure to follow the installation correctly.

# Features
*NOTE: This is still in development, and definetly not finished. A ton of features are not in yet.*
- Read market data of any item in-game.
- Read Incursion data of all active constellations.
- Read system information, like Industry index etc.
- Much more to come.

# Installation (Not recommended)
To use EVEPy in your project, you will have to manually install it. This is due to it still being in active development, and packaging at this stage is not worth it. It is highly recommended to check this page for updates at least every other week. Now, let's get going!
1. Download this repository.
2. Create a folder inside your project. (I recommend calling it "EVEPy", as documentation will reference it like this)
3. Drag and drop the contents of this repository inside there.
4. Run setup.py. It will install the dependencies required by this library. (Re-run this after EVERY update to validate your dependency list!
5. Enjoy! Our documentation will guide you through everything you need to know!

# Usage warning
This project is in active development, and has no official release yet. Using it inside a project may have some small bugs, or may have terrible error messages (as I am still writing them). You have been warned.
